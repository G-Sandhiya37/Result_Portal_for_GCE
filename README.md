Result_Portal_for_GCE

The portal functions as an online result checking system where students can input their credentials to access their semester results. The process is straightforward and divided into the following steps:

1.Login Page:

The first page a user encounters is the login interface.
Students are required to enter three key pieces of information:
      1.Register Number
      2.Date of Birth
      3.Semester Number
      
2. Input Validation:

If any of the fields are left blank, a prompt is displayed: "All fields are required".
If incorrect details are entered that don’t match the stored data, an "Invalid Data" message is shown.
This ensures only authorized students can access the system.

3. Result Display:

Upon successful login, the portal displays the student’s result for the selected semester.
The result includes subject-wise grades, grade points, and total SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average).
The layout is clean and structured for easy understanding.

4. Print Option:

Students can choose to print their result directly from the portal.
A dedicated "Print" button generates a print-friendly version of the result.
